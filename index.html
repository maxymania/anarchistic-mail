<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Anarchistic Mail (in short A-Mail) is a Project, that makes a set of Protocols for a seperate E-Mail-Like Mail System with Privacy in mind.</p>
<p>It is a bit similar to Dark Mail, but simpler, and seperate, not complement, to the E-Mail standard.</p>
<p>That means, that you can't send a A-Mail to an E-Mail-Address, nor an E-Mail to an A-Mail-Address (Though there will be Gateways for this)</p>

<p>One goal is to Provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full encryption of both text and metadata</li>
<li>Remailer-like capabilities (Type III)</li>
<li>Anonymous sending</li>
<li>Deniability (if wanted)</li>
</ul>

<p>Short Term Goals</p>
<ul>
<li>Design the Protocols, Formats and Encryption shemes for A-Mail</li>
<li>Create Reference implementations</li>
<li>Create an A-Mail client</li>
</ul>

<p>Long Term Goals</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a Gateway (-software) to receive E-Mails with an A-Mail Account.</li>
<li>Create a Gateway (-software) to send A-Mails to E-Mail-Addresses.</li>
</ul>
